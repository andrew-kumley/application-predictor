This project is intended to predict whether an applicant will bring meaningful contribution using their application alone. 
The project was created for an online gaming community I was a part of, but slowly developed into a major learning experience for me. I collected the data of applications that were accepted from around the past two years, which amounted to around 500 applications. Then, as stated before, a model attempts to predict whether that applicant brought meaningful contributions, which in less-vague terms means they acquired a certain rank.
